# Clothing and Shoe Manager Application

## What will the application do?
Users will be able to login to this application, **upload their clothing and shoe items, find items based on criteria, 
and make outfits**.

*For Example:*
- A User can upload their wardrobe of clothes and shoes.
- With a wardrobe available they can find all their white t-shirts, all items from a specific brand, or jackets of 
  certain materials.
- Additionally, the user can add clothing pieces to an outfit, by adding different items from their wardrobe together.

## Who will use it?
This application is targeted towards streetwear enthusiasts and sneaker heads, who want to view their collection, make
outfits of items that fit well together, and sort their wardrobe.

## Why is this project of interest to me?
I personally am a big fan of streetwear and sneakers, and would love to have an application that allows me to see my
entire collection, make outfits, and see what clothing pieces I have that are similar to each other.
